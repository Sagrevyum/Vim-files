# .vimrc

This is my custom, cleaned and updated .vimrc. I'll update this readme as I
progress. I'm basing on Amix's awesome .vimrc file, but this is not a fork.
Also, this is customized for me, should you use it, you should read it and
customize it for you too.

Amix .vimrc
    https://raw.github.com/amix/vimrc/

For a fresh install in a new machine:
    git clone https://github.com/Heldraug/Vimfiles.git
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To update every bundled plugin:
    git submodule foreach git pull origin master
